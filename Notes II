Constraints for the iPhone X
TL;DR If you see a gap at the bottom of the screen when you run on iPhone X, despite completing the autolayout tutorial in the next lesson. You can use the steps below to solve this issue.

The reason is because the constraints are constraining to the "Bottom Layout Guide"(safearea on certain versions of Xcode). Follow these steps to change the constraint to the "true" bottom.

1. Change the canvas to iPhone Xs

2. Select the background view

3. With the background still selected, go to the size inspector and double click on the constraint that's called "Bottom Space to".

4. Change the first dropdown to Superview and the constant to 0.

          Set it to 1:2.1

Distribute Block based off content
  Go to Parent Stack View and change to "Fill Proportionally"
